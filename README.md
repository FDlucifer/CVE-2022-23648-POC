## PoC for CVE-2022-23468

This is a proof of concept for [@_fel1x](https://twitter.com/_fel1x)'s CVE-2022-23468. The `Containerfile` has the info. needed, and you can change the target of the VOLUME to try out different paths.

Easiest way to show it working is to use [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/) which is currently (March 2022) exploitable.

## Test procedure

- `kind create cluster`
- `kubectl create -f pod-manifest.yaml`
- `kubectl exec poctest -- ls /var/lib/kubelet/pki/`

And if you get back files including `kubelet.key` it worked :)
